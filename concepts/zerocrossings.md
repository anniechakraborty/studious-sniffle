# What are zero crossings?

### 1. **First derivative**

* The first derivative $f'(x)$ measures slope.
* Its **zero crossings** (points where it changes sign) indicate **local maxima and minima** (critical points).

### 2. **Second derivative**

* The second derivative $f''(x)$ measures **curvature** (concavity).
* A **zero crossing of the second derivative** happens when $f''(x) = 0$ and the sign of $f''(x)$ changes around that point.

### 3. **Meaning of zero crossings in $f''(x)$**

* These points are called **inflection points**.
* At an inflection point, the function changes concavity:

  * From concave up ($f''(x) > 0$) to concave down ($f''(x) < 0$), or vice versa.

### 4. **Example**

Take $f(x) = x^3$:

* $f'(x) = 3x^2$ â†’ slope is 0 at $x = 0$.
* $f''(x) = 6x$ â†’ zero at $x = 0$.
* $f''(x)$ changes from negative to positive across 0 â†’ so $x=0$ is an **inflection point**.

### 5. **Important note**

* Not every point where $f''(x) = 0$ is an inflection point (example: $f(x) = x^4$, where $f''(0) = 0$ but thereâ€™s no sign change).
* So the **true zero crossings of $f''(x)$** are only where the sign actually flips.

ðŸ‘‰ In short: **Zero crossings in the second derivative indicate inflection points â€” where a functionâ€™s concavity changes.**
